# 👁️ Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains my **computer vision projects**, where I explore how machines understand images and videos in practical, real-world scenarios.

The focus here is not just on using models, but on building **clean, scalable vision pipelines** — from loading data automatically to processing, visualizing, and analyzing results.

### What you’ll find here
- Object detection and image analysis projects
- Experiments using OpenCV and YOLO
- Folder-based automation instead of hard-coded inputs
- Real-world images with noise, clutter, and variation

### Tech stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLO
- NumPy, Pathlib
- and Much More...

This repository will continue to grow as I go deeper into **computer vision and applied AI**, with future work aligned toward **medical and biomedical imaging**.

> Learning computer vision by building, experimenting, and improving — one project at a time.
